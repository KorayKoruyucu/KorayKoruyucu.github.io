								<p>Recently, the US Federal government banned online casinos from operating in America by making it illegal to transfer money to them through any US bank or payment system.

								Highly distinguished participants of the Nesibe Aydın Model United Nations 2021 conference, NAMUN’21 
								<br><br>
								I, Bahar Elif BÜLBÜL the Director-General have the honour of  welcoming you all to the annual session of NAMUN,
								<br><br>
								This year is the 10th anniversary. Our predecessors have left a legacy for us that we will pass on to many more generations of coming teams.	
								With our extensive simulation of Model United Nations and our well-thought-out social activities, our conference has always aspired to boost delegates’ academic and social skills.
								<br><br>
								Both our organization and academic team have gone the extra mile to give you the best experience possible.
								Last year due to the ongoing pandemic it wasn’t possible for us to organize our conference face-to-face.
								This year, unfortunately, we can’t organize our conference face-to-face because of MEB restrictions.
								While we are saddened, our online conferences give a chance for international delegates to attend NAMUN’21. We hope to see you face-to-face next year. 
								<br><br>
								This year, our public relations team has come up with various virtual coffee break activity ideas.
								Our team wants to make sure that you, as delegates, have a chance to grow while working with teams, making new connections, and improving your social skills thanks to our spectacular coffee break activities. Our aim has always been to provide all of our delegates with a chance to grow as a person and hope to prepare them for a professional approach in their future lives.
								We hope you enjoy your time at NAMUN21! Ten years going strong!
								<br><br>
								DIRECTOR GENERAL OF NAMUN’21
								<br>
								Bahar Elif BÜLBÜL
